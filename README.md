<h1> AirGNG </h1>
** Still in progress **

<h2> Project information </h2>
This project was a collaboration of two other team members of my class cohort. Our goal was to make an up and running AirBnB knock off website. We were able to get functions such as links to reviews, reservations, and login up and running before we had to present. I have now forked this project and am working on it to create a fully functional site.
